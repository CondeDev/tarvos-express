# Tarvos Express

Structure to work with API express, with the configuration of ESLINT and Prettier, using sucrase and nodemon to run the project.

- npm install -g tarvos-express

- tarvos-express -p testApi

## Reason
Most of the time when we start a new API Express project, always start from scratch, creating the folder architecture, making the default installations and the default settings for express. Wanting to avoid all this repetitive flow, this CLI was created, where it already brings all the project architecture and standard configurations.

## How to contribute
To make a contribution to the project, just implement it in a branch and then open a PR.

The more we get better at this project, the better for the entire developer community.
